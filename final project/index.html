        <!-- Heading for the section -->
        <p class="sectionSubTag small">The gramophone, also known as the phonograph, was invented by Thomas Edison in 1877. Edison's initial goal was to create a device for transcribing telegraph messages, but he discovered that it could also reproduce sound. Emile Berliner, a German-born American inventor, later made significant improvements to the design by using flat discs instead of cylinders. The gramophone quickly gained popularity for its ease of use and mass-produced records, revolutionizing how people experienced music and laying the foundation for the modern music industry. </p>
